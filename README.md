# Gman Speech Simulator

A little experiment that I made in Godot 3.2

It takes audio source files inside the assets folder, divided by the grammar typology of word.

IIn the scripts folder, there is the main.gd script connected to the Main.tscn scene, it generates random quotes based on a timer.

For the moment it's feed by the Half Life 1 Gman audio source files.

Hope to make it more interactive.
